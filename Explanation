Stage 1:
1) Calculated % growth of funding between year 2008 & 2009.
2) If funding was positive, it was tagged as 1, if funding was negative then 0. This was the target variable.
 
Stage 2:
1) Graphs of univariate distribution of all non funding variables was created. 
   Just FYI - Funding FY2008, FY2009, FY2010 are the "funding variables"
2) mutual_info_score of target variable created in stage 1 & ALL non funding variables was calculated.
 
Stage 3:
1) Data is divided into train & test samples. (70-30 split)
2) Features were selected &  xgboost model was build and judged on roc_auc_score on test sample.
3) Testcases on all user defined functions wsa tested using pytest framework.
